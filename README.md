## About the Project

Agathos showcases the potential of 3D web design. The webpage was conceptualized in Figma, where the initial designs and user interface components were carefully crafted. Following the design phase, assets were optimized and prepared in Photoshop, ensuring that they were ready for high-quality animations.

Programatically you would pull the Spline animations/events in using their custom hooks and apply them to the appropriate React 3 Fiber elements. That is beyond the scope of this project though.

## Preview

Below is a screenshot from the Figma design phase, showing the layout and design elements that were developed for Agathos.
